# 🚚 PSO Courier Route Optimization

This project aims to optimize courier delivery routes using the **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** algorithm.  
By minimizing total travel distance or time, the system helps couriers follow the most efficient delivery path, improving overall logistics performance.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

- Users create and cancel delivery orders.
- Couriers receive an **optimized delivery route** calculated by PSO.
- If an order is canceled, the system **recalculates** the route dynamically.
- The depot acts as both **start and end point** in the route.
